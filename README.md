### 4. Secure file storage with Hybrid Cryptography

**Domain**: Security

**Tags**: Cloud Security

**Technology**: AWS S3, Azure File Storage

**Complexity**: Intermediate

**Description**: Create a project to store file in completely secured manner, as the file is being encrypted not by just using one but three encryption algorithm which are AES, DES and RC6. Application ensures security of the userâ€™s data stored on cloud by providing a tool that helps to encrypt files. The user must receives the key via email.

### 5. Realtime Social Media Sentiment Analysis

**Domain**: Sentiment Analysis

**Tags**: Machine Learning (NLP)

**Technology**: GCP AutoML , Azure ML Studio

**Complexity**: Intermediate

**Description**: Create a project for the Sentiment Analysing to predict the emotional state of an individual based on the data input from the person's social media posts and interactions. To perform this analysis, integrate platform like twitter, instagram, etc., to the website or the mobile application and take the user authorized account name and process the data accordingly in your backend server and finally display the result of analysis performed i.e. the emotional state of the individual whose account name was provided.
